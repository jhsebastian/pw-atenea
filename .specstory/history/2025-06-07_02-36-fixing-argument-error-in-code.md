For the code present, we get this error:
```
Expected 2-3 arguments, but got 1.
```

I can see the issue in your test file. There's a syntax error in the test declaration - there's an extra parenthesis after the test description. Let me fix that for you.

I'll edit the file to correct the syntax:


---

```diff
  });
  
- test('TC-2 Verificar boton de registro está inhabilitado'), async ({ page }) => {
+ test('TC-2 Verificar boton de registro está inhabilitado', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/');
  
```

---

The error occurred because there was an extra closing parenthesis `)` after the test description. The correct syntax for a Playwright test is:
```typescript
test('test description', async ({ page }) => {
```

I've removed the extra parenthesis, which should resolve the linter error. The test should now compile correctly.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Property 'value' does not exist on type 'Locator'.
```

The error occurs because in Playwright, to get the value of an input field, you need to use `inputValue()` instead of `value()`. Let me fix that for you:


---

```diff
    await page.locator('input[name="lastName"]').fill('Martinez');
    await page.locator('input[name="email"]').fill('sebas'+Math.random()+'@gmail.com');
-   console.log('email', page.locator('input[name="email"]').value());
+   console.log('email', await page.locator('input[name="email"]').inputValue());
    await page.locator('input[name="password"]').fill('123456');
    await page.getByTestId('boton-registrarse').click();
```

---

I made two changes:
1. Changed `value()` to `inputValue()`
2. Added `await` since `inputValue()` returns a Promise

This should resolve the TypeScript error and correctly log the email value.

I see you're encountering a Git lock file error. This typically happens when a Git process was interrupted or crashed, leaving behind a lock file. Let me help you resolve this.

I'll run a command to remove the lock file:


---

```bash
rm -f .git/index.lock
```

```

```

The lock file has been removed. You should now be able to proceed with your Git commands normally. Try running `git add .` again and it should work without the lock file error.
